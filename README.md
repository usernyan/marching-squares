# marching-squares
A visualization of the marching squares algorithm in C++ with SDL2

Compile and run with ```make;./squares_marching```

### Controls

Use ```0```, ```-```, and ```=``` to reset, decrease, and increase the value at which the contour line is drawn, respectively.

Use ```i``` to toggle linear interpolation on/off.

Use ```o``` to cycle between different environments (metaball, random, sine wave, wavy parabola).

### Credits
Thanks to The Coding Train, who's [video on the Marching Squares algorithm](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/coding-in-the-cabana/c5-marching-squares/) done in Processing inspired this project.
