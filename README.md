# marching-squares
A visualization of the marching squares algorithm in C++ with SDL2

Compile and run with ```make;./squares_marching```

### Controls

Use ```0```, ```-```, and ```=``` to reset, decrease, and increase the value at which the contour line is drawn, respectively.

Use ```i``` to toggle linear interpolation on/off.

Use ```o``` to cycle between different environments (metaball, random, sine wave, wavy parabola).

Use ```p``` to pause the environment.
